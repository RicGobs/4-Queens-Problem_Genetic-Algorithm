# 4-Queens-Problem Genetic-Algorithm

A program in PROLOG to solve N-Queens problem for N=4 using a Genetic Algorithm.

Download the program, write on your terminal the string '[queens].', then write the string 'queens([[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,1]],R).' .

The program will solve the 4 Queens Problem and the solution are two.
If you want to try to solve the N Queen Problem for a N>4 you have to change the line 111 (change the value of L) and the lines between 99 and 102 (add new column for the array, A5 and C5, or more).
This is my first project using Prolog and Genetic Algorithm, so the program is slightly inefficient.
