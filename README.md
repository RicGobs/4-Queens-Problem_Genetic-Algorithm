# 4-Queens-Problem Genetic-Algorithm
A program in PROLOG to solve N-Queens problem for N=4 using a Genetic Algorithm.
Download the program, write on your terminal the string '[queens].', then write the string 'queens([[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,1]],R).' .
The program will solve the 4 Queens Problem and the solution are two.
If you want to try to solve the N Queen Problem for a N>4 you have to change the line 111 (change the value of L) and the lines between
